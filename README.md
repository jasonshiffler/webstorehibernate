# webstorehibernate

This project is based on the book Spring MVC Beginner's Guide Second Edition by Amuthan Ganeshan. There are a couple deviations between what's in the book and this project:

-I used Hibernate instead of JDBC queries. Can't recommend this enough.
-I built my project on Ubuntu instead of Windows. There are some relative path locations that would need the / changed to \ in order for it to work on Windows. The handling of multipart requests for file uploads is one example.
-The book used STS, I built the project as J2EE using Eclipse.
-The author used HyperSQL DB. I went with MySQL instead.

Like the author I tried to use Java based configuration as much as possible.
